Convicted to change this, I gathered like-minded Computing classmates and initiated code4.ny, a project to code a web app to gather attendance during a crisis. The development process was not in our curriculum, thus we encountered issues surrounding UI plans, implementations, and database structures. Persevering through these setbacks was extremely challenging, but through it, we found new ways to adapt to new territories. Made an MVP application with a local database to present to our vice-principal.",
